#  OpenWeather API application provides only single location weather information

By Dileep Gaddam

.Used static images from assets.

.Used only programatical interface instead of storyboard and scope of making constraints code generic.

.Scalabel API to make the requests for number of APIs depends on user interest.

. Not written test cases for API nor for UI.

.Change the city id in Service Configuration file to check for other cities.
